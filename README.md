## Feature Oriented Active Modeller

Foam is a Modeller: describe your data's properties, methods, event topics,
listeners, dependencies, etc., and Foam will generate your javascript classes.
Use them with Foam's data access layer for easy offline support and pick your
favorite front end framework.

While Foam is written in Javascript, it can be used to generate code for any
language or platform. Android and iOS Swift support are on the way.
